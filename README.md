# Breadth-First-Search-Algorithm
Implementation of the Breadth-First Search Algorithm.


In this problem, we would like to compute the minimum number of flight segments to get from one city to another one.

We are given an undirected graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges and two vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣. we try to compute the length of a shortest path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 (that is, the minimum number of edges in a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣).
